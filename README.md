## What is GenAI ?

Generative AI (Gen AI) refers to a branch of artificial intelligence that can generate new content such as text, images, audio, video or even software code based on patterns and examples it has learned from existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily analyzes or categorizes data, generative AI creates something new that didn't exist before. The output is generated by algorithms, often using techniques like deep learning and neural networks.

## Prompting Techniques

### Zero-shot Prompting

There is no example or prior guidance is given. The model is expected to respond based only on the prompt.

- Prompt : What is the capital of india?
- Output : New Delhi

### One-shot prompting

A single example of the desired task is provided in the prompt. The model uses that example to infer what is expected in similar scenarios.

- Prompt : Translate 'Hello' to Tamil: 'வணக்கம்'. Now translate 'Goodbye' to Tamil
- Output : விடைபெறுகிறேன்

### Few-shot prompting

Several examples of the task are given to the model to help it understand the context or pattern before generating its response.

- Prompt : Translate the following,
    - 'Good morning' to Hindi: 'शुभ प्रभात'
    - 'Good night' to Hindi: 'शुभ रात्रि' 
    - Now translate 'How are you' to Hindi.
- Output : आप कैसे हैं

### Chain-of-thought prompting

The model is encouraged to "think aloud" or break down its reasoning step-by-step before arriving at the final answer. This is useful for complex reasoning tasks.

- Prompt : If a train travels 60 miles per hour and needs to travel 120 miles, how long will it take? Explain your reasoning.
- Output : The train travels 60 miles in 1 hour. To travel 120 miles, it would take 2 hours because 120 ÷ 60 = 2.

### Instruction prompting

The model is explicitly instructed to perform a specific task, often using clear and direct instructions.

- Prompt : Write a short story about russia ukraine war.

### Multi-turn prompting

The prompt involves multiple rounds of interaction where the model responds to ongoing instructions or questions. It's useful for tasks that require back-and-forth interactions.

- Prompt 1 : What is the largest country in the world?
- Output 1 : Russia
- Prompt 2 : What is its population?
- Output 2 : 14.42 Cr

### Contextual prompting

The model is given a specific context (such as a document or background information) and is asked to perform a task based on that context.

- Prompt : Based on the following job description, give me the key qualification?

### Direct prompting

The user asks the model to generate something directly without much guidance or context.

- Prompt : Write a poem about my wife?

### CoT (Chain of Thought) prompting

The prompt explicitly guides the model to reason through a problem in multiple steps, useful for tasks involving logic or multi-part answers.

- Prompt : Please go through the file for more clear example.
